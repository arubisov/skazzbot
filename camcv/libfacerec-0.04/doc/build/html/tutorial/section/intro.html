<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Face recognition is an easy task for humans. Experiments in <a class="reference internal" href="../../bib/literature.html#tu06">[Tu06]</a> have shown, that even one to three day old babies are able to distinguish between known faces. So how hard could it be for a computer? It turns out we know little about human recognition to date. Are inner features (eyes, nose, mouth) or outer features (head shape, hairline) used for a successful face recognition? How do we analyze an image and how does the brain encode it? It was shown by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Hubel">David Hubel</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel">Torsten Wiesel</a>, that our brain has specialized nerve cells responding to specific local features of a scene, such as lines, edges, angles or movement. Since we don&#8217;t see the world as scattered pieces, our visual cortex must somehow combine the different sources of information into useful patterns. Automatic face recognition is all about extracting those meaningful features from an image, putting them into a useful representation and performing some kind of classification on them.</p>
<p>Face recognition based on the geometric features of a face is probably the most intuitive approach to face recognition. One of the first automated face recognition systems was described in <a class="reference internal" href="../../bib/literature.html#kanade73">[Kanade73]</a>: marker points (position of eyes, ears, nose, ...) were used to build a feature vector (distance between the points, angle between them, ...). The recognition was performed by calculating the euclidean distance between feature vectors of a probe and reference image. Such a method is robust against changes in illumination by its nature, but has a huge drawback: the accurate registration of the marker points is complicated, even with state of the art algorithms. Some of the latest work on geometric face recognition was carried out in [Brunelli92]. A 22-dimensional feature vector was used and experiments on large datasets have shown, that geometrical features alone don&#8217;t carry enough information for face recognition.</p>
<p>The Eigenfaces method described in <a class="reference internal" href="../../bib/literature.html#tp91">[TP91]</a> took a holistic approach to face recognition: A facial image is treated as a point from a high-dimensional image space and a lower-dimensional representation is found, where classification becomes easy. The lower-dimensional subspace is found with Principal Component Analysis, which identifies the axes with maximum variance. While this kind of transformation is optimal from a reconstruction standpoint, it doesn&#8217;t take any class labels into account. Imagine a situation where the variance is generated from external sources, let it be light. The axes with maximum variance do not necessarily contain any discriminative information at all, hence a classification becomes impossible. So a class-specific projection with a Linear Discriminant Analysis was applied to face recognition in <a class="reference internal" href="../../bib/literature.html#belhumeur97">[Belhumeur97]</a>. The basic idea is to minimize the variance within a class, while maximizing the variance between the classes at the same time (Figure ref{fig:scatter_matrices}).</p>
<p>Recently various methods for a local feature extraction emerged. To avoid the high-dimensionality of the input data only local regions of an image are described, the extracted features are (hopefully) more robust against partial occlusion, illumation and small sample size. Algorithms used for a local feature extraction are Gabor Wavelets, Discrete Cosinus Transform and Local Binary Patterns (<a class="reference internal" href="../../bib/literature.html#ahonen04">[Ahonen04]</a>).</p>
